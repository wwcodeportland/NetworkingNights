## FAQs

#### What is the Networking Night series?
Our Networking Night is a monthly event for our members to get together, learn something new from great speakers, and get to know a new tech company in Portland. We want to build a community of technical women in Portland and we hope you will help us in that endeavor.

#### When is it held?
You decide. We have had one every night of the week. The time frame is typically 6-9 PM, but some companies have requested to start at 5 or 5:30 PM and some companies prefer to end the event by 8 PM.

#### How many people attend?
It depends. One of our earliest events had 30 attendees. Our **Networking Night + 3rd Anniversary Party** had 206 attendees and we checked in 303 people for the **Women+Tech Summer Soiree***. Depending on the capacity of the space, we can cap attendees for the event. Typically, we plan the event for 50-60 people.

#### What does a hosting organization expected to provide?
We would like our host to provide the location, food, speakers, and a theme. We can and have helped with finding speakers and coming up with a theme. Both the speakers and the theme should represent your company.

#### What does Women Who Code Portland provide?
We advertise the event to our members via Meetup, Eventbrite, our newsletter, and our Slack channel. We also help draft some graphics to advertise the event. Finally, we will feature your logo on our github repo, website, and during various presentations.

#### Do all speakers need to be women?
No. However, we prefer to showcase women speaking. If we are going to encourage women to join or stay in the tech workforce, we need to showcase smart, successful, and well-spoken women as speakers at meetups and conferences.

#### Why should my company host a Networking Night?
We hope you will want to host us to support our organization, our organization's goal of empowering women in tech, and to support the women currently working at your company. While this is a speakers series and not a hiring event,  any event can be a recruiting event. This is the time for your company to promote yourself to our community.
